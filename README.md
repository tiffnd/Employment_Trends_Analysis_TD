# USA Employment Trends Analysis (2014–2024)
This is a project I put together to explore changes in U.S. employment over time using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the years 2014–2024. 
It includes an Excel file with visualizations and a SQL walkthrough showing how I’d approach the analysis if the data were stored in a live database. 
I focused on identifying month-to-month changes and year-over-year trends, including any major events like the impact of the COVID pandemic in 2020. 
I chose this dataset because it felt like a good fit to demonstrate how I think through problems and structure an analysis. It’s relevant and detailed enough to show how I go about breaking down data, identifying trends, and organizing my findings, while also keeping the process as efficient as possible along the way.
